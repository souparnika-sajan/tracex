## Basic Details

### Team Name: [innovo]

### Team Members
- Member 1: souparnika sajan- [LBSITW]
- Member 2: sreelekshmi R- [LBSITW]

### Hosted Project Link
https://tracex-two.vercel.app/

### Project Description
A mobile app that helps find missing people. Relatives can register a missing person with a photo, and the app uses face recognition to detect them. When a match is found, the family and police are notified with the person’s location.

### The Problem statement
It is hard for families and authorities to quickly find missing people, especially in crowded places or public areas.

### The Solution
Use a mobile app with face recognition to automatically detect missing people and send instant notifications with their location to families and police.

## AI Tools Used (Optional - For Transparency Bonus)

If you used AI tools during development, document them here for transparency:

nil

**Key Prompts Used:**
- "Create a REST API endpoint for user authentication"
- "Debug this async function that's causing race conditions"
- "Optimize this database query for better performance"

**Percentage of AI-generated code:** [Approximately X%]

**Human Contributions:**
- Architecture design and planning
- Custom business logic implementation
- Integration and testing
- UI/UX design decisions

*Note: Proper documentation of AI usage demonstrates transparency and earns bonus points in evaluation!*
